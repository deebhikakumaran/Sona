Sona is a next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the **Soneium network**, utilizing **Account Abstraction (AA)** technology to simplify DeFi interactions for users. By combining **AI-powered vault strategies**, **cross-chain capabilities**, and a **gasless user experience**, Sona empowers users to easily optimize their crypto investments without the complexities typically associated with DeFi. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, Sona’s seamless and personalized services are designed to maximize returns with minimal effort.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Sona is to create a user-friendly platform that makes sophisticated DeFi strategies accessible to everyone. DeFi is powerful but can be intimidating for newcomers due to the complexity of managing transactions, understanding yield farming strategies, and dealing with gas fees. With Sona, we aim to democratize DeFi by leveraging **AI** to automate decision-making, making high-yield strategies accessible with a **gasless** experience.

## Market

The DeFi market is growing rapidly, with billions locked in decentralized protocols across a wide range of chains. However, the market remains fragmented, with numerous barriers such as high gas fees, complexity in managing cross-chain assets, and a lack of easy-to-understand user experiences. Sona is targeting this gap by offering a **simplified** and **user-first** approach to investing in DeFi with **AI-powered optimization**. The platform will appeal to both beginner users who are just getting started in DeFi and experienced users who want more advanced, passive income strategies.

## Problem

1. **DeFi Complexity**: Many users find it challenging to navigate through various DeFi protocols, especially with manual asset management, yield optimizations, and understanding risk.
2. **Gas Fees**: High gas fees can eat into profits, especially for smaller or frequent transactions.
3. **Fragmented Cross-Chain Ecosystem**: DeFi users have to manage assets across different chains, which can be cumbersome and lead to missed yield opportunities.
4. **Lack of Personalization**: Many platforms offer generalized solutions that don’t take into account an individual’s unique risk profile or goals.

## Solution

Sona provides a **personalized, AI-driven vault management system** that optimizes yield across multiple DeFi protocols. By integrating **Account Abstraction (AA)** technology, Sona offers **gasless transactions**, and by using cross-chain capabilities (e.g., Optimism), it enables users to easily take advantage of opportunities across multiple ecosystems.

Key features include:

- **AI-powered vault recommendations** based on the user’s risk profile.
- **Gasless vault transactions** via Account Abstraction.
- **Cross-chain interactions** to take advantage of opportunities in different blockchain ecosystems.
- **Adaptive yield strategies** based on market signals, risk, and historical performance.
