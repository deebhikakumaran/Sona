## Overview

Sona is a smart, autonomous DeFi vault platform built for the Soneium Network. It enables users to passively grow their crypto assets by automatically optimizing yield across top-performing vaults in the ecosystem. Sona removes the complexities of DeFi through Account Abstraction (AA) and AI-driven automated strategies.

## Motivation

The DeFi market continues to grow rapidly, with increasing TVL across multi-chain ecosystems. However, most users remain inactive due to usability barriers. There’s a demand for simplified tools that abstract away technical details while still providing high returns. Sona targets both new DeFi users and passive crypto holders who want smarter asset growth.

## Market

The DeFi market is growing rapidly, with billions locked in decentralized protocols across a wide range of chains. However, the market remains fragmented, with numerous barriers such as high gas fees, complexity in managing cross-chain assets, and a lack of easy-to-understand user experiences. Sona is targeting this gap by offering a **simplified** and **user-first** approach to investing in DeFi with **AI-powered optimization**. The platform will appeal to both beginner users who are just getting started in DeFi and experienced users who want more advanced, passive income strategies.

## Problem

- Navigating DeFi is complex and often intimidating.
- Users must bridge assets, choose protocols, and manually manage yield strategies.
- High gas fees and complex interfaces are blockers.
- Users miss out on optimal rewards because of fragmented vault options across protocols.

## Solution

Sona solves these problems by offering:

- Automated vault selection and optimization powered by AI
- Gasless experience through Account Abstraction
- Auto-bridging, swapping, and rebalancing, all managed by Sona's backend
- Seamless UX for deposit, yield farming, and reward claiming without user friction

## Key Feature

- AI Agent: Fully automated asset management and rebalancing based on APY and platform performance
- Cross-chain Yield Access: Bridge, swap, and invest in top-performing pools across multiple networks
- Portfolio Dashboard: Real-time updates on yields, tokens, and growth
- Modular Vault Architecture: Strategy-isolated vaults designed for scalability and safety
- Gasless Interaction: Powered by Account Abstraction (AA) and Smart Contract System (SCS)
